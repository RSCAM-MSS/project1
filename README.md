Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is a powerful Bayesian inference method. It breaks up posterior integration into a nested product of low dimensional integrals, and this makes it applicable to high dimensional complex models where MCMC is too slow. Recently INLA has been successfully used for predicting the outcomes of soccer matches. The goal of this project is to explore the basic ideas of INLA, and implement several models of increasing complexity for predicting the outcomes of soccer matches.
